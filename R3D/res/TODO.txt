1) Reimplement rendering
	A) Simple renderer for colored, untextured basic shapes (box, sphere, plane) with
	   lights(point, omni, torch), bloom, hdr, and shadows.
	B) Simple renderer for any mesh, with material (textures [diffuse, normal, specular], shininess).
		- keep shader at beginning (then, renderer should organize data first renderables according to their shader). 
	C) Instanced renderer for basic shapes.
	D) Organize renderables according to shader, material.
	E) Acceleration (frustrum culling ...)

2) Camera controls: pan, rotate, zoom (like in blender)

3) Physics for spheres

4) Physics optimizations with spatial queries

Future:
 - Forward Plus rendering
 - Deferred rendering
 - Physically Based rendering
