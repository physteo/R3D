FBO: draw quad using fbo. Need to change the basic loop on the Application class.

*** read themachinery for dpi options
*** Imgui docking changes fontscale of titles
*** better managing input and camera modes
*** shader editing at runtime

1) Reimplement rendering
	A) Instanced renderer for colored, untextured basic shapes (box, sphere, plane) with
	   lights(point, omni, torch) and shadows.
	B) Renderer for any mesh, with textures (diffuse, normal, reflection).
		- keep shader at beginning (then, renderer should organize data first renderables according to their shader). 
	C) Acceleration (frustrum culling ...)

2) Physics optimizations with spatial queries

3) Camera controls
