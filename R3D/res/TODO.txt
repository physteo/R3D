Problems:
*** read themachinery for dpi options
*** Bug: ImGui docking changes the fontscale of titles
*** Managing input (put keys in the Window class?)

Features:
1) Reimplement rendering
	A) Forward renderer for colored, untextured basic shapes (box, sphere, plane) with
	   lights(point, omni, torch), bloom, hdr, and shadows.
	B) Deferred renderer (features as above).
	C) Deferred renderer for any mesh, with material (textures [diffuse, normal, specular], shininess).
		- Renderer should organize renderables according to their material (shader) first. 
	D) Instanced renderer for basic shapes.
	E) Acceleration (frustrum culling ...)

2) Camera controls: pan, rotate, zoom (like in blender etc)

3) Physics for spheres

4) Physics optimizations with spatial queries

Future:
 - Forward Plus rendering
 - Physically Based rendering
